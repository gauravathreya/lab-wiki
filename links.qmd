- Generally useful fact: You can push your local git repo to two or more remote locations simultaneously. To set this up, we need to run the following locally on the terminal:
```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
git remote set-url origin --push --add <a remote>
git remote set-url origin --push --add <another remote>
```
