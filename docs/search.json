    "text": "Hawk-Dove Game\nIn this model there is a population of Hawks (\\(H\\)) and a population of Doves (\\(D\\)). We assume that Hawks and Doves compete for food in pairwise interactions. When interacting, Hawks “fight to death” and Doves “retreat when attacked”. When a bird gets the food its Darwinian fitness (say number of children) increases by \\(V\\). When a fight occurs, the injured opponent experiences a reduced fitness of \\(C\\).\n\nPayoffs\nTherefore, when a Hawk meets a Hawk, we get the expected payoff i.e. expected increase in fitness to be\n\\[E(H,H) = \\dfrac{1}{2}(V-C)\\]\nThis is because we assume that half the time the Hawk will win and half the time it will lose. When at Hawk meets a Dove, it gets the entire meal, i.e.\n\\[E(H,D) = V\\]\nWhen a Dove meets a Hawk it will get nothing since it retreats immediately. Therefore,\n\\[E(D,H) = 0\\]\nFinally, when a Dove meets a Dove, both can sit peacefully and enjoy their meal implying\n\\[E(D,D) = \\dfrac{V}{2}\\]\nThis information can be written as a matrix \\(M\\) that will have useful properties.\n\n\nPayoff Matrix\nFor a two-player, two-strategy game like the one we are discussing we write:\n\\[M = \\bigg[\\begin{matrix} E(A,A)&E(A,B)\\\\ E(B,A)&E(B,B) \\end{matrix}\\bigg]\\]\nwhere \\(E(A,B)\\) is the expected payoff for a player playing strategy \\(A\\) against an opponent playing \\(B\\).\n\nPayoff Matrix for the Hawk-Dove Game\n\\[M = \\bigg[\\begin{matrix} (V-C)/2&V \\\\ 0&V/2 \\end{matrix}\\bigg]\\]\n\ndef M(V,C):\n    M = np.array([[(V-C)/2,V],[0,V/2]])\n    return M\n\n\n\n\nNet Payoff\nNow that we have a compact description of the model in the form of the matrix, we would like to get a sense of what happens when there are multiple interactions going on between birds in the wild. If the interactions happen completely at random, the frequency of \\(H\\) individuals is \\(p_H\\) and the frequency of \\(D\\) individuals is \\(1-p_H\\), then the expected fitness for a Hawk can be written as:\n\\[W(H) = W_0 + p_HE(H,H) + (1-p_H)E(H,D)\\]\nSimilary, the fitness for a Dove can be written as:\n\\[W(D) = W_0 + (1-p_H)E(D,D) + p_HE(D,H)\\]\nwhere \\(W_0\\) was the fitness of all the birds before the contests began.\n\ndef W(M,pH,W0=5):\n    W = W0+np.matmul(M,np.array([pH,1-pH]).T)\n    return W\n\n\n\nThe Notion of Equilibrium\nThis is great. We now have a sense of the mean fitness of the animals in the two populations. It is intuitive (but we will make it precise) that when the fitness of the two populations is equal, their population sizes will not change.\nOn equating \\(W(H)\\) and \\(W(D)\\), we can derive\n\\[p_H = V/C\\]\nThis is a nice result that tells us that if \\(V/C&gt;0.5\\) then there will be more Hawks than Doves and if \\(V/C&lt;0.5\\) there will be more Doves than Hawks. When \\(V/C&gt;1\\), it is possible to show from the following equations that \\(p_H = 1\\).\n\n\nHow can we make this notion of equilibrium more precise?\nSince we want to understand how strategies change over time we can make the simplifying assumption that Hawks and Doves reproduce asexually and their population growth in the next generation \\(p_H'\\) depends on their fitness in this one\n\\[p_H' = p_H \\dfrac{W(H)}{\\bar{W}}\\]\nwhere \\(\\bar{W} = p_H W(H) + (1-p_H)W(D)\\)\nIt can now be seen that when \\(p_H'-p_H = 0\\), the system is in equilibrium. This gives us \\(W(H) = W(D)\\). Now that we have an equation that evolves in time, it’s time to play around with some values of \\(V\\) and \\(C\\).\n\n#Define functions to calculate frequency and evolve according to repliator equation\n\ndef pHt(pH,W):\n    pHt = (pH*W[0])/(pH*W[0]+(1-pH)*W[1])\n    return pHt\n\ndef evolve(V,C,pH0=0.5,T=5,dt=0.1):\n    time = np.arange(0,T,dt)\n    pH = np.ones(np.size(time))*pH0\n    for i,t in enumerate(time):\n        pH[i] = pHt(pH[i-1],W(M(V,C),pH[i-1]))\n    return (time,pH)\n\n\n#Set parameters\n\npH0 = 0.5\nV = 4\nC = 2\n\n#plot\n\nplt.plot(evolve(V,C)[0],evolve(V,C)[1])\nplt.ylim(-0.1,1.1)\nplt.xlabel(\"$t$\");\nplt.ylabel(\"$p_H$\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(V/C = 2 &gt; 1\\) the Doves were driven to extinction.\n\nV = 1\nC = 3\n\nplt.plot(evolve(V,C)[0],evolve(V,C)[1],label='_nolegend_')\nplt.axhline(0.33,linestyle='--',color='seagreen',alpha=0.5)\nplt.legend([\"0.33\"])\n\n\nplt.ylim(-0.1,1.1)\nplt.xlabel(\"$t$\");\nplt.ylabel(\"$p_H$\");\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince \\(V/C = 1/3\\), \\(pH\\) goes to \\(0.33\\).\n\nfrom celluloid import Camera\n\nC = 1; V = np.arange(0,2,0.1)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (7,5))\nplt.ylim(-0.1,1.1)\nplt.xlabel(\"$t$\")\nplt.ylabel(\"$p_H$\")\ncamera = Camera(fig)\nfor v in V:\n    plt.plot(evolve(v,C,T=10)[0],evolve(v,C,T=10)[1],'k')\n    plt.legend(['$V/C = '+str(np.round(v/C,1))+'$'])\n    camera.snap()\nplt.close()\n\nYou can play around with the slider belo to change the value of \\(V/C\\).

    "text": "The notion of an ESS\nWe can now take the above notion of equilibrium and extend it further. In our model we had two strategies \\(H\\) and \\(D\\). An evolutionarily stable strategy is one in which if you start with a population consisting of only that strategy, another strategy should not be able to take over. It can be shown that for a two-player, two-strategy game like Hawk-Dove, a strategy \\(A\\) is an ESS if:\n\\[\\text{Either} \\ E(A,A)&gt;E(B,A) \\qquad [1]\\]\n\\[\\text{or} \\ E(A,A) = E(B,A)\\ \\text{and}\\ E(A,B) &gt; E(B,B) \\qquad [2]\\]\nThis can be generalised in the form of arrow patterns for \\(M\\) in which arrows are drawn towards the highest valued neighbour in the vertical direction:\n\nIf both arrows point along one strategy, that is the ESS.\nIf both arrows point in different directions, then the arrow pointing towards the diagonal element specifies the ESS.\nIf there is no arrow pointing towards a diagonal element, there is a mixed ESS (in our case \\(p_H \\in (0,1)\\)).\nIf one of the arrows is a double arrow representing equality, the other arrow determines the ESS (pure if towards diagonal element, else mixed)\n\nNote that it can also be shown for a two-player, two-strategy game that an ESS always exists.\n\nWhat is a mixed ESS?\nGames in which a strategy can be played with probability \\(P\\) and another by probability \\(Q\\) by the same individual can have mixed ESS in which the evolutionarily stable outcome has individuals playing different strategies with different probabilities. In our simple example, a mixed ESS is equivalent to the case of neither population of birds going extinct. Cf. Maynard Smith (1982) for a more careful definition of a mixed strategy and its relation to the frequency of a pure strategy at equilibrium.\nIt is easy to see that conditions \\([1]\\) and \\([2]\\) guarantee an ESS.",

This value is obtained by simplifying \\(\\mu(V/2-C) + (1-\\mu)V/2\\), and thus, \\(\\mu\\) can be interpreted as the probability that a reciprocator will play a hawk strategy when it encounters another reciprocator.

    "text": "One dimensional systems\nOne-dimensional systems are equations of the form  \\[\n\\dot{x} = f(x)\n\\]  where \\(\\dot{x}\\) denotes the derivative of \\(x\\) with respect to time and \\(f\\) is a (non-linear) function. For instance, the logistic equation\n\\[\n\\dot{x} = x(1-x)\n\\]\nis an example of a one-dimensional non-linear system. Let us see how we may study this system.\n\ndef logistic(x,t):\n    return x*(1-x)\n\n\nFinding fixed points diagrammatically\nOften, we are only interesed in the behavior of our biological system at equilibrium (or over very long timescales). In this case, we are interested in finding points at which \\(\\dot{x} = 0\\) (the quantity \\(x\\) is no longer changing). Such points are called fixed points of the system. To find fixed points of a one-dimensional system, we can plot \\(\\dot{x}\\) vs \\(x\\). The points at which this curve intersects the x-axis are then the fixed points of our system.\n\nxarray = np.arange(-0.01,1.01,0.001)\nxdotarray = [logistic(x,0) for x in xarray]\nplt.plot(xarray,xdotarray)\nplt.axhline(y=0,color='g',linestyle='--')\nplt.xlabel('x')\nplt.ylabel('x dot')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, we see that the only fixed points of this system are \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\).\nWe can also ask which fixed points of the system are attractors. If we begin at, say, \\(x=0.01\\), will the system move towards \\(x=0\\) or \\(x=1\\)? This too can be answered diagramatically. Notice, in the plot above, that \\(\\dot{x}\\) is positive when \\(x \\in [0,1]\\). Thus, if \\(x\\) is between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), it will increase (since the rate of change is positive) towards \\(x = 1\\). However, if \\(x&gt;1\\), then \\(\\dot{x}\\) is negative, meaning that \\(x\\) tends to decrease. This means that systems with \\(x&gt;1\\) tend to decrease towards \\(x=1\\) - the point \\(x=1\\) is an attractor!\nWe can confirm this by numerically integrating the logistic equation for a variety of initial conditions\n\ndef logistic_trajectory(x0list,t=10,tstep=0.01):\n    for x0 in x0list:\n        xlist = np.arange(0,t,tstep)\n        ylist = odeint(func=logistic,y0=[x0],t=np.arange(0,t,tstep))\n        plt.plot(xlist,ylist,label='x0 = '+str(x0))\n    \n    plt.legend(loc='upper right')\n    plt.xlabel('time')\n    plt.ylabel('x')\n    plt.axhline(y=1,color='g',linestyle='--')\n    plt.show()\n\nlogistic_trajectory([0.02,0.1,0.25,1.5,2])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more complicated example with a single tunable parameter\nConsider now the more complicated system\n\\[\n\\dot{x} = rx - x^3\n\\]\nwhere \\(r\\) is a model parameter.\n\ndef xdot(x,t,r):\n    return r*x - x**3\n\n\n\nThe fixed points\nTo begin, let us study the fixed points of the system. As before, we do it graphically\n\ndef xdot_vs_x(rlist):\n    for r in np.arange(rlist[0],rlist[1],rlist[2]):\n        x = np.arange(-10,10,0.01)\n        xdotlist = []\n        for val in x:\n            xdotlist.append(xdot(val,0,r))\n        \n        plt.plot(x,xdotlist,label='r = '+str(r))\n    plt.axhline(y=0,color='g',linestyle='--')\n    plt.axvline(x=0,color='g',linestyle='--')\n    plt.legend(loc='upper right')\n    plt.xlabel('x')\n    plt.ylabel('x dot')\n    plt.xlim([-5,5])\n    plt.ylim([-10,10])\n    plt.show()\n\n\nxdot_vs_x([-6,6.1,6])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of fixed points changes depending on the parameter!\n\nfrom celluloid import Camera\n\nrlist = np.arange(-10,10,0.1)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize = (8,8))\nplt.ylim(-0.1,1.1)\nplt.xlabel(\"x\")\nplt.ylabel(\"x dot\")\ncamera = Camera(fig)\nfor r in rlist:\n    xlist = np.arange(-10,10,0.1)\n    ylist = [xdot(x,0,r) for x in xlist]\n    plt.plot(xlist,ylist,color='r')\n    plt.axhline(y=0,color='g',linestyle='--')\n    plt.axvline(x=0,color='g',linestyle='--')\n    plt.legend(['$r = '+str(np.round(r,1))+'$'],loc='upper right')\n    plt.xlabel('x')\n    plt.ylabel('x dot')\n    plt.xlim([-5,5])\n    plt.ylim([-10,10])\n    camera.snap()\nplt.close()\n\nYou can play around with it here:\n\nplt.rcParams[\"animation.html\"] = \"jshtml\"\nanimation = camera.animate()\nanimation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n      \n          \n      \n        \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n      \n          \n    \n    \n      \n      Once\n      \n      Loop\n      \n      Reflect\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolving the ODE\n\nObtaining an analytic solution\nThis can also be seen by actually solving the differential equation. I will use sympy to analytically solve the differential equation\n\n#Solving the given ODE symbolically\nn,r = symbols('n r')\ninit_printing()\nn_dot = r*n - n**3\n\nsolve(n_dot,n)\n\n\\(\\displaystyle \\left[ 0, \\  - \\sqrt{r}, \\  \\sqrt{r}\\right]\\)\n\n\n\n\nNumeric integration to find trajectories\nSince solving ODEs analytically is not always feasible, we could also use numerical integration to obtain the trajectory, i.e the values of \\(x(t)\\) as \\(t\\) varies, given an initial value \\(x_0\\). Here, I use the odeint package from scipy.\n\ndef trajectory(rlist,x0,t=10,tstep=0.01):\n    xlist = np.arange(0,t,tstep)\n    for r in rlist:\n        ylist = odeint(func=xdot,y0=[x0],t=np.arange(0,t,tstep),args=tuple([r]))\n        plt.plot(xlist,ylist,label='r = '+str(r))\n    \n    plt.legend(loc='upper right')\n    plt.xlabel('time')\n    plt.ylabel('x')\n    plt.show()\n\n\ntrajectory(np.arange(-4,4.1,4),1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependence on parameters\nFinally, we can examine how the number of fixed points varies as we vary parameters. In our case, the system has a single parameter: \\(r\\).   We examine the relationship between fixed points and parameter values by plotting a bifurcation diagram. In this case, we plot \\(r\\) against the corresponding equilibrium values of \\(x\\), for various initial values \\(x(0)\\).\n\ndef bifurcation(r_range):\n    rvals = np.arange(r_range[0],r_range[1],r_range[2])\n    eq_list = []\n    r_list = []\n    for r in rvals:\n        for x in np.arange(-10,10.1,5):\n            unique_sols = np.unique(odeint(func=xdot,y0=[x],t=np.arange(0,1000,1),args=tuple([r]))[900:1000])\n            for sol in unique_sols:\n                eq_list.append(sol)\n                r_list.append(r)\n    \n    plt.scatter(r_list,eq_list,color='g',s=2)\n    plt.xlabel('r')\n    plt.ylabel('x*')\n    plt.show()\n        \n\n\nbifurcation([-4,4.1,0.1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis diagram tells us that when r is less than 0, there is a single fixed point present at x = 0. At r = 0, the behaviour changes, and two new fixed points appear for all values of r &gt; 0. Values of \\(r\\) at which such changes occur are known as bifurcation points.",

Trajectories move away from the center and go towards the edges of the simplex. In both computer simulations and real populations, this generally means that one of the strategies will go extinct, even though theoretically, the edges are never reached.",
